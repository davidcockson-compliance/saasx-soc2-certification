> **Note:** This is an educational/demonstration project for a fictional company 'SaaSX'. No real compliance data is contained in this repository. This project serves as a template and learning resource for understanding SOC 2 Type II certification processes.

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains the comprehensive documentation, policies, procedures, and evidence collection framework for SaaSX's SOC 2 Type II certification project. SOC 2 Type II demonstrates that our organization has implemented and operates effective controls over security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy over a specified time period (typically 6-12 months).

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Achieve SOC 2 Type II certification to demonstrate robust security and compliance controls
- Build and maintain a sustainable compliance framework
- Document all policies, procedures, and controls required for SOC 2
- Establish continuous monitoring and evidence collection processes
- Prepare for annual audit and recertification

## 📊 Project Status

**Current Phase:** Phase 0 - Project Setup  
**Start Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Target Audit Date:** TBD  
**Audit Period:** TBD
